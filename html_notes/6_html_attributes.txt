HTML ATTRIBUTES
HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.

--> HTML Attributes
	* All HTML elements can have attirbutes
	* Attribute provide additional information about elements
	* Attributes are always specified in the start tag
	* Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

--->The href Attribute

The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:
	<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>

---> The src Attribute

The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:
	<img src="img_girl.jpg">

There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

1. Absolute URL - links to an external image that is hosted on another website.
Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg

Note: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be violation the copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

2. Relative URL - Links to an image the is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg".

Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.

---> The width and height Attributes

The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image(in pixels):
	<img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">

--->The alt Attribute

The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.
	<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">

---> The style Attribute

The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.
	<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

---> The lang Attribute

You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the web page. This is ment to assist search engines and browsers.

The following example specifies English as the language:
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html lang="en">
	<body>
	----------
	</body>
	</html>

Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.

The following example specifies English as the language and United States as the country:
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html lang="en-US">
	<body>
	---------
	</body>
	</html>

We can see all the language codes in our HTML langauage code reference.

---> The title Attribute

The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.

The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:
	<p title="I'm a tooltip"> This is a paragraph.</p>

We suggest: Always use lowercase Attributes
-------------------------------------------
The HTML standard does not require lowercase attribute names.

The title attribute (and all other attributes) can be written with uppercase or lowercase like title or TITLE.

However, W3C recommends lowercase attributes in HTML, and demands lowercase attributes for stricter documents types like XHTML.

We Suggest: Always Quote Attribute Values
-----------------------------------------
The HTML standard does not requires quotes around attributes values.

However, W3C recommends quotes in HTML, and demands quotes for stricter document types like XHTML.

---> Single or Double Quotes?

Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.

In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes;
	<p tilte='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>

Or vice versa:

	<p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson">
