What is an element in HTML?
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

<tagname> Content goes here...</tagname>

The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<h1> My First Heading </h1>

<p> My first paragraph. </p>

START TAG	ELEMENT CONTENT		END TAG
<h1>		My First Heading	</h1>
<p>		My first paragraph	</p>
<br>		none			none

NOTE: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!
